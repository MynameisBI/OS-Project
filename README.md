## How to run
* **Make sure to download the executable from the releases**
Other players only need the client.zip while the host need to have the server.zip too
In case you want to run multiple client instances in the same machine, just run the client executable again
* **After you download all the right files**, first the host need to run the server executable, after that all players can run their client executable and it will automatically connect to the server and ready to play
